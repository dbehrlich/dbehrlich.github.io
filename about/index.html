			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> I received my baccalaureate from New York University, concentrating in Quantitative Behavioral Economics and Applied Neuroscience. After Graduating I moved to Yale to work with Dr. Ifat Levy at the Decision Neuroscience Lab. I am currently a graduate student in the lab of Dr. John Murray, doing work both in analysis of electrophysiological data in complement with theoretical work utizling recurrent neural networks. </p>
            <p> I am particularly interested in two main domains: 1) the neural circuit structures underlying higher order cognition including decision making and working memory, 2) perceptual processing in dynamic environments. </p>
